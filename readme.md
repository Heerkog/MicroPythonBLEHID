<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This library offers implementations of Human Interface Devices (HID) over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) GATT for MicroPython.
The library has been tested using an ESP32 development board ([TinyPICO](https://tinypico.com)) as the peripheral and Windows 10 as the central.
Examples and basic implementations of HID devices are available for

- Keyboard,
- Mouse, and
- Joystick.

This library is NOT intended to offer functionality for every possible HID device configuration.
Instead, the library is designed to offer basic well-documented classes that you can extend to fit your HID device needs.
For example, the Mouse class offers a three button mouse with vertical scroll wheel.
If you plan on developing a gaming mouse with eight buttons and both vertical and horizontal wheels, you will need to extend the Mouse class and overwrite the required functions to include a new HID report descriptor.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The library offers functionality for creating HID services, advertising them, and setting and notifying the central of HID events.
The library does not offer functionality to, for example, send a string of characters to the central using the keyboard service (eventhough this is included in the keyboard example).
The reason for this is that such functionality is entirely dependent on the intended use of the services and should be kept outside of this library.

The library consists of five classes with the following functions:

* `HumanInterfaceDevice` (superclass for the HID service classes, implements the Device Information and Battery services, and sets up BLE and advertisement)
  * `__init__(device_name)` (Initialize the superclass)
  * `ble_irq(event, data)` (Internal callback function that catches BLE interrupt requests)
  * `start()` (Starts Device Information and Battery services)
  * `stop()` (Stops Device Information and Battery services)
  * `write_service_characteristics(handles)` (Writes Device Information and Battery service characteristics)
  * `load_secrets()` (Loads stored secrets for Bluetooth bonding)
  * `save_secrets()` (Saves secrets for Bluetooth bonding)
  * `start_advertising()` (Starts Bluetooth advertisement)
  * `stop_advertising()` (Stops Bluetooth advertisement)
  * `is_running()` (Returns `True` if services are running, otherwise `False`)
  * `is_connected()` (Returns `True` if a central is connected, otherwise `False`)
  * `is_advertising()` (Returns `True` if advertising, otherwise `False`)
  * `set_state(state)` (Sets one of the `HumanInterfaceDevice` constants `DEVICE_STOPPED`, `DEVICE_IDLE`, `DEVICE_ADVERTISING`, or `DEVICE_CONNECTED`. Doesn't change the actual function. Used internally)
  * `get_state()` (Returns one of the `HumanInterfaceDevice` constants `DEVICE_STOPPED`, `DEVICE_IDLE`, `DEVICE_ADVERTISING`, or `DEVICE_CONNECTED`)
  * `set_state_change_callback(callback)` (Sets a callback function that is called when the `HumanInterfaceDevice` state changes between constants `DEVICE_STOPPED`, `DEVICE_IDLE`, `DEVICE_ADVERTISING`, or `DEVICE_CONNECTED`))
  * `get_device_name()` (Returns the device name)
  * `get_services_uuids()` (Returns the service UUIDs)
  * `get_appearance()` (Returns the device appearance id)
  * `get_battery_level()` (Returns the battery level)
  * `set_device_information(manufacture_name, model_number, serial_number)` (Sets the basic Device Information characteristics. Must be called before calling `start()`)
  * `set_device_revision(firmware_revision, hardware_revision, software_revision)` (Sets the Device Information revision characteristics. Must be called before calling `start()`)
  * `set_device_pnp_information(pnp_manufacturer_source, pnp_manufacturer_uuid, pnp_product_id, pnp_product_version)` (Sets the Device Information PnP characteristics. Must be called before calling `start()`)
  * `set_bonding(bond)` (Set whether to use Bluetooth bonding)
  * `set_le_secure(le_secure)` (Set whether to use LE secure pairing)
  * `set_io_capability(io_capability)` (Set input/output capability of this device Determines the pairing procedure, e.g., accept connection/passkey entry/just works. Must be called before calling `start()`)
  * `set_passkey_callback(passkey_callback)` (Set callback function for pairing events. Callback function should return boolean to accept connection or passkey depending on I/O capability used)
  * `set_passkey(passkey)` (Set the passkey to use for pairing)
  * `set_keystore(keystore)` (Sets the key store to use from `hid_keystores.py`. Default `JSONKeyStore`)
  * `set_battery_level(level)` (Sets the battery level internally)
  * `notify_battery_level()` (Notifies the central of the current battery level. Call after setting battery level)
  * `notify_hid_report()` (Function for subclasses to override)

* `Joystick` (subclass of `HumanInterfaceDevice`, implements joystick service)
  * `__init__(name)` (Initialize the joystick)
  * `start()` (Starts the HID service using joystick characteristics. Calls `HumanInterfaceDevice.start()`)
  * `write_service_characteristics(handles)` (Writes the joystick HID service characteristics. Calls `HumanInterfaceDevice.write_service_characteristics(handles)`)
